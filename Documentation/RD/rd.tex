\chapter{Project Plan}
The project plan for the first four weeks is explained in this chapter. The goal is to discover the services to be provided by the successor of Blackboard. We base our project plan on the requirements engineering process, see Figure \ref{fig:spiral_model} \cite{RE_book} (chapter 1.1.6). This book identifies four phases of requirements engineering; 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Domain understanding and elicitation.
	\item Evaluation and negotiation.
	\item Specification and documentation.
	\item Quality assurance.
\end{enumerate}

During the first week we will get familiar with the problem world, as described in the first phase \cite{RE_book}. We will investigate the system-as-is ourselves, and ask users (students) about their experiences. We will work trough the questions listed in the relevant section in the book. We will also compose a list of stakeholders, which we interview in the coming weeks.

Week 2 will resolve around the second phase: evaluation and negotiation. During this week we will interview remaining stakeholders, to verify and add upon the information we gathered in the first week. Interviewing all relevant stakeholders is crucial during this week, as it is a required input to this the evaluation and negotiation phase, and subsequent phases. Due to limited time we can interview maximally 3 stakeholders per group. If a stakeholder is not readily available we will not use his/her input in the requirements engineering process. 

During week 3 we will draft an initial set of requirements. After week 3 the first draft version of the Requirements Document is finished. We will focus on the smallest set of requirements that together realize the business goals on an acceptable level, due to limited time. 

In week 4 we will plan meetings with relevant stakeholders to asses the set of requirements we drafted for the new system. Assessment focuses on whether we forgot crucial requirements and if the requirements are consistent.  

Note that we conduct one round of the spiral model, see Figure \ref{fig:spiral_model}. There will be some backtracking to other phases (previous weeks), because some information becomes available after the relevant week/phase.

\section{Glossary of terms}
\todo{List all relevant terms in the problem world}

\section{Organization}
The organization in which Blackboard is used is the University of Amsterdam (UvA). 

The organization within which the system-as-is takes place: its structure, strategic objectives,
business policies, roles played by organizational units and actors, and dependencies
among them.

\section{Goal}
The goal of a requirement engineering project in a perfect world would be strife to find all of most important quality requirements for all relevant stakeholders. As stated in Contextual Design \cite{contextual_design} a design process could always be further elaborated, so finding all and every requirements for all stakeholders is an illusion.

Because of this and the time constraints of this project, the goal will be limited to the following: \emph{find a couple of the major requirements for the main stakeholder(s)}. We believe this is measurable enough for the assignment given the time frame but still enough of an abstraction given that we do not yet have a clear enough understanding of the domain at this time to make it more concrete without taking away from the achieveability.

\section{Scope}
The scope of the system-as-is: its underlying objectives, the components forming it, the
concepts on which it relies, the tasks involved in it, the information flowing through it,
and the constraints and regulations to which the system is subject.

\section{Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Users: Both students and teachers
	\item Management:
	\item Blackboard (company):
\end{itemize}

The set of stakeholders to be involved in the RE process.

\section{Strengths and Weaknesses}
Students:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[+] Easy way to access course specific information.
	\item[+] Latest schedule of course.
	\item[-] Hard to use in the beginning.
	\item[-] Only marginal functionality used, e.g. "We \textit{have} to use it."
\end{itemize}



The strengths and weaknesses of the system-as-is, as perceived by the identified stakeholders.
