\chapter*{Reading assignment week 4}

\section*{4.1}
I was already familiar with all the models presented in Chapter 8 of \emph{Requirements	in Engineering Projects}\cite{req_en_book} so I found some different models. Some more suitable for the Blackboard project than others.

\subsection*{SysML requirements diagram \cite{sysml}}
Provides a way to visually manage and represent system requirements. A requirements is shown as a block, connections are used to show groupings and dependencies of requirements.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{+}] Model dependencies between requirements.
	\item[\textbf{+}] Create groupings to manage dependencies between multiple requirements.
	\item[\textbf{-}] If many requirements are represented in a single model it might get too complex for stakeholders to understand.
\end{itemize}

Example: \\
See Figure \ref{fig:sysml_req_diagram}, the requirement of distilled water shall be met by boiling water, which has dependencies on different subsystems.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Communication Diagram \cite{communication_diagram}}
Models the communication between objects. Connections are used to represent the need for communication during execution between objects.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{+}] Messages are grouped for easy repositioning.
	\item[\textbf{+}] Use swimlanes to represent layers of a system.
	\item[\textbf{+}] See where trade-offs need to be made.
	\item[\textbf{-}] Low level.
\end{itemize}

Example:\\
Can be used for modelling the interaction of the user with the UI and the system (Figure \ref{fig:communication_diagram}). Or for modelling the inter system communications. This could be used to test the requirements.

	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Resources/4_communication_diagram.png}
	\caption{Example communication diagram.}
	\label{fig:communication_diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Process life-cycle diagram \cite{sysml}}
Used to model the life-cycle of sub-processes to parent processes.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{+}] Communicate the life-cycle of processes within the business and possibly with stakeholders.
	\item[\textbf{+}] Could also be used to model the life-cycle of system processes.
	\item[\textbf{-}] Seems more appropriate to model business process than requirements/system processes.
	\item[\textbf{-}] Does not model any data.
\end{itemize}

Example:\\
See Figure \ref{fig:lifecycle_diagram}, sub-processes are grouped within the life-cycle of parent-processes.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Resources/4_lifecycle_diagram.png}
	\caption{Example process life-cycle diagram.}
	\label{fig:lifecycle_diagram}
\end{figure}

\section*{4.1}
Good models for organizing the knowledge about the successor of Blackboard would be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sysml requirements diagram
	\item Dependency diagram
	\item System context diagram
	\item Decision trees
	\item Goal/requirements trees
\end{itemize}
All these model either dependencies between requirements, knowledge and decisions, or the scoping of (sub)systems. They can be used to reason about knowledge or about the requirements of the system-to-be. \emph{ps: this is off course, by any means, not an exhaustive list..}


\section*{4.2}
You can do this with a system where certain types of knowledge are grouped together, such as domain understanding through research or knowledge acquired from elicitations. hm.. blabla iets van Lamsweerde of contextual design insert hier
