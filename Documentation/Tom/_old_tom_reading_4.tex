\section*{4.1}

\subsection*{Transformational \cite{req_en_book}}
Based on the requirements a formal specification is defined. This is progressively developed until a working system can be derived from the formal definition. The system (or part of it) is generated automatically from the formal specifications.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{+}] System automatically generated from formal specifications.
	\item[\textbf{+}] Theoretically, if the specification is verified, the resulting system has no defects.
	\item[\textbf{+}] Specification and implementation will not diverge.
	\item[\textbf{-}] Difficult to manipulate the (formal) specifications.
	\item[\textbf{-}] Only applicable to very specific systems.
	\item[\textbf{-}] Need sophisticated development tools.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Spiral \cite{req_en_book}}
Based on a risk-driven approach instead of documents or code and centres on the identification and elimination of problems with high risk. Tasks are organised in cycles, where each cycle constitutes of four tasks.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{+}] Could remove some of the risks associated with big projects.
	\item[\textbf{+}] When the requirements (after n cycles) are known a different process can follow.
	\item[\textbf{-}] Adds significant effort to the definition and development process.
	\item[\textbf{-}] Meta-model used to instantiate different process models.
