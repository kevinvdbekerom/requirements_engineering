            <p><h3> Interviews </h3></p>
            <p>This week, as part of the group assignment, we reassessed what we had learned up until this point, which questions we (partially)
            answered and on which questions we want to focus for the remainder of the assignment. With that in mind we prepared the questions for
            the interviews for this week.</br>
            </br>
            The questions we wanted to answer with the interviews:</br>
            - What are the study goals of the student?</br>
            - Does Blackboard help achieve these goals?</br>
            </br>
            Keeping in mind what Kahneman and the papers from last week have taught us, we did not want to straight out ask the question 
            ("What are your goals as a student") as this would yield very abstract definitions as this is not a question people think about
            very often.</br>
            So instead we worked towards this question by asking some preliminary questions first:</br>
            - What subjects did you follow last block?</br>
            - What kind of assignments did these subjects entail, individual or group?</br>
            - Were these assignments graded with a real grade or just a pass/fail?</br>
            - How did you study for your final exam, did you have a specific strategy?</br>
            - Did you use sources not provided by your teacher to get relevant study material?</br>
            - Did you involve other students in this study process?</br>
            </br>
            All these questions were used to work towards the final question with the intent of having the interviewee think about specific events
            about his study behaviour so he remembers as much details as possible. With all these connections fresh in his mind, and primed on his
            way of studying, we believed we would have a very good chance on a reliable and detailed answer.</br>
            </br>

            <p><h3> About the snippet </h3></p>
            <p>We created this snippet to show our intent as described above.</br>
            It starts out with Tom giving a summary of some of the preliminary questions, and then asking the final question about the student goals.</br>
            What we taught was very interesting about this interview was that the interviewee gave a very unexpected answer. After all these preliminary
            questions we were so focused on the goals that we already formulated in our minds a possible answer to the question ("I just want to pass" or
            "I want to pass but my main goal is to get intrinsic value along the way" or something in between). The interviewee gave a totally unexpected
            answer and after and after that it was hard to recover and get the focus of the interview back on the study goals of the interviewee.
            <p></br>
            
            <p><h3> Reflection </h3></p>
            <p>This week we focused a lot better on getting answers specific to our goals. We also avoided talking in the abstract by having the 
            interviewee recall past events.</br>
            </br>
            
            <b>Interview 1:</b> [Tom]</br>
            After asking all the preliminary questions and having prepared this interview with only the interviewee' study goals in mind I was
            surprised when I got an answer to the question that I worked towards that did not fit with my mental model of the situation.</br>
            Instead of stating her study goals she started talking about her personal life, which was totally unexpected for me. Therefore I 
            had trouble getting the interview back on the rails, focused on our main question. Still in the end had enough information to
            infer the type of student she was.</br>
            <b>What we learned:</b></br>
            The main study goal of the interviewee is passing the exams, but she goes the extra mile as well. Next to Blackboard she uses 
            other sources of information as well, on the internet but also other students. Though we deem the reliability of her goals
            questionable as we do not think she properly understood what we meant.</br>
            <b>To be improved in the next interview:</b></br>
            Our final question was not phrased properly, by asking about the 'type' of student we brought up other associations than we had in mind.
            To combat this we tried to devise a phrasing focused more on the study goal but we did not succeed without being very suggestive. We ended up 
            up phrasing it as a closed question instead, something we wanted to avoid on the onset.</br>
            </br>
            
            <b>Interview 2:</b> [Kevin]</br>
            Foo.</br>
            <b>What we learned:</b></br>
            Bar.</br>
            <b>To be improved in the next interview:</b></br>
            FooBar.</br>
            </br>
            
            <b>Interview 3:</b> [Tom]</br>
            When asked about the goals the question landed better than during my first interview. I also believe the answers are quire reliable as the
            interviewee gave certain hints about the type of student he was, asking more about this he confirmed it.</br>
            <b>What we learned:</b></br>
            The main goal of the interviewee is passing the different subjects and get hit degree, whenever he feels Blackboard does not properly support
            him in this he looks for information elsewhere.</br>
            <b>To be improved next week:</b></br>
            Formulate questions better, for example instead of "When you look at, last block, could you tell me about, what subjects did you follow" 
            just ask "Which subjects did you follow last block?". Also our strategy, first asking a series of preliminary questions to let the interviewee
            create the cognitive links needed to answer the last question gave mixed results, we might try a different strategy next week.</br>
            </br>
            
            Things still to improve:
            <ul>
              <li>Be prepared to anticipate unexpected answers.</li>
              <li>Formulate/structure questions more clearly.</li>
              <li>.</li>
              <li>.</li>
              </ul>

            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>The contract for Blackboard comes to an end, so the UvA (University of Amsterdam) will need a new 
            student-education system in the short future. Software Engineering master students Tom van Duist, and 
            Kevin van den Bekerom will extract relevant requirements for the new system by means of several assignments,
            which can be read on this blog.
