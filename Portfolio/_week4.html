            <h3> Reflection </h3></p>
            <p>During the first four weeks of the Requirements Engineering course we created a requirements document (RE),
            we will now reflect on that process.</br>
            </br>
            
            <h4>Provide a rationale for the organization of your document:</h4>
            We based the structure of our document on the process as described in "Requirements Engineering, 
            From System Goals to UML Models to Software Specifications" by Axel van Lamsweerde.</br>
            The structure follows the spiral model of the requirements engineering process. This gives us a
            section on 'Domain understanding and elicitation', 'Evaluation and negotiation' and 'Specification and
            documentation', we left out the last phase, 'Quality assurance' as it does not fit within the scope
            of this assignment.</br>
            </br>
            The advantage of this structure is that we can add new information, be it from research of elicitations, to
            the section 'Domain understanding and elicitation'. The next section will build upon the gathered information,
            evaluate it and makes trade-off's between certain stakeholder needs.</br>
            In other words, whenever new information is added to the domain understanding, this will flow down to the
            evaluation section.</br>
            In the last section 'Specification and documentation' all this information is distilled into the requirements.</br>
            </br>
            The downside of this structure is that it is supposed to be a spiral, but because of the fact that we are learning 
            the requirements engineering process as we go we had to backtrack to previous phases each week. So each week 
            that we added a new phase we were also adding things in the previous phase. Sometimes it felt as if we were in all 
            phases at the same time.</br>
            We could have prevented this by performing a whole pass through the spiral each week, but this proved 
            difficult as we learned new things during the week, from the lectures and also from the reading material.</br>
            </br>
            
            <h4>Show what you learned about requirements engineering and how this relates to the learning goals of the course:</h4>
            Learning goals:</br>
            1) Reliably capture the needs of the users:</br>
            We learned different interviewing techniques to get reliable answers to the questions we wanted to get
            answered. We applied different techniques from Kahneman, and were aware of pitfalls, also presented
            in Kahneman.</br></br>
            
            2: Systematically gather and structure the captured data to determine system requirements:</br>
            We learned different ways to structure the data that we gathered and derive the system requirements from this.
            More specifically from Contextual Design and gathering and modeling stakeholder goals to requirements by van 
            Lamsweerde.</br></br>
            
            3: Learn about different best practices in Requirements Engineering (elicitation techniques, gathering information,
            processes etc.):</br>
            In a real-world setting we learned how our teacher would tackle the Blackboard problem. This was initially very
            different than our apporach. We learned his best practises, and were given the opportunity to partially apply them.
            </br></br>
            
            4: Logically model and express system requirements and trade-off's:</br>
            We learned how to apply the goal-driven requirement technique as presented in van Lamsweerde. This also
            stresses the important fact of first learning what the goals of your stakeholders are, and relating the requirements to these goals.</br></br>
                       
            <h4>Show what you learned about elicitation and your ability as interviewer:</h4>
            We first learned a lot about how NOT to perform an elicitation by first doing it wrong in practice. 
            Then by reading Kahneman's book and certain papers (e.g. on apprenticing, empathic listening, 
            contextual design) we learned suggestions on how to do it right and were able to better prepare
            and perform the elicitations. Looking back at our first interviews we asked not very effective
            and biased/suggestive questions. The reading material taught us about positive cue's, cognitive load,
            mental models and connections, substitution. In our later interviews, especially week 3, we were able
            to make a constructive plan, and reflect upon the outcomes, as to get the most reliable information possible.</br>
            </br>
            
            <h4>What did you learn about identifying and gathering useful hard / objective / measurable data?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>That it is hard to deal with the unreliability of the human mind.</li>
                <li>Certain techniques on how to get information that is (more) reliable during an interview:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Verbal and non-verbal cue's.</li>
                        <li>Techniques to trigger memories and connections (e.g. apprenticing).</li>
                        <li>Use the minds (unconscious) substitution of hard questions to your advantage.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Don't trust small numbers.</li>
                <li>Objective statements should be refutable, otherwise they are next to meaningless.</li>
                <li>If you want useful information you have to <strong>ask the right questions</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>First gather the goals of the stakeholders.</li>
                        <li>How does the current system support these goals.</li>
                        <li>Which features are needed to support these goals.</li>
                        <li>Which goals are important for the success of the system.</li>
                        <li>When these questions and other system/project specific questions are answered
                        the requirements and their importance will become clear.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </br>
            
            <h4>What can you learn from the current use of blackboard for the future use of any DLO?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The system does not need to be very 'usable'. It can still be used effectively with certain types of
                usability issues.</li>
                <li>Users will always turn to sources outside of Blackboard to get additional information.</li>
                <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a> seems to hold for the use of Blackboard:
                    <ul>
                        <li>80% of the users only use 20% of the features.</li>
                        <li>Many features are used by just a small subset of users.</li>
                        <li>For most users, all these extra features are just confusing because they don't use them anyways.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>None of the users that we interviewed appreciated many of the complex features of Blackboard 
                that the UvA board thinks are important (judging from Richard van der Wurff' intermediate report) such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Personalizability.</li>
                        <li>Adaptability with tools and modules.</li>
                        <li>Personal communication (e-mail in Blackboard).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
            </ul>
            </br>

            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>The contract for Blackboard comes to an end, so the UvA (University of Amsterdam) will need a new 
            student-education system in the short future. Software Engineering master students Tom van Duist, and 
            Kevin van den Bekerom will extract relevant requirements for the new system by means of several assignments,
            which can be read on this blog.
